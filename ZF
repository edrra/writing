Maths is about proving true statements, so naturally the mathematician
tried to find a way to reason about the process of maths itself. In the
end, the widely used construction is something called ZF which is based
on sets - everything is a set in this world And it turns out you can
write maths in terms of sets, in a set zoo - where you can pull sets
together, intersect them, take subsets of sets and for new ones etc etc.

In this world of sets only one set is taken to exist which is the empty
set. All other sets descend from this set.

Recently for some reason my mind wonders to this place. This emptiness
by being refactored and re worked again and again leaves behind
something maximally complex. I think about it in those brief empty
moments of life, those moments that I've lived ten thousand times, among
days that are completely indistinguishable from one another, I think
about the this constellation of emptiness we are creating.
