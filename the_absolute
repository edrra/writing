the speed of light is a property of an empty vaccuum. Since an empty
vaccum is the same in all reference frames, the speed at which a photon
is observed to be travelling must be the same in any reference frame.
This foundational axiom sounds ludicrous but it means things that we
once held absolute (time) must give way to being relatie. In essence,
the acceptance of an absolute truth will bend and warp reality.

Imagine then a mother who lost their child in a pointless war - can they
accept that the war was for nothing? Most likely they will refuse to
accept this, with their starting assumption that their child died for
something. In this way, their reality too will be warped, things held
true will no longer be so, reality will begin to twist
